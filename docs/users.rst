Managing User Accounts
**********************

The IU BAP website integrates user account authorization with IU's `CAS <http://indiana.edu/kb/CAS>`_ system, which alleviates the need to actually create accounts for all users and manage their passwords. Users still need to be managed in the sense of giving certain people as members or faculty and giving some people permissions to perform certain actions (eg. editing site content or managing users). Almost all user account management takes place on via the User Management page at :menuselection:`Admin --> Users`

.. Note:
	Because CAS doesn't provide a way to query for existing users, only users that have logged in to the site at least once will exist in the user management interface. It is possible to create an account using the proper username, however, and that account will be tied to the CAS user the first time they do log in.
