Tutorial: Creating Pages for a an Event
***************************************

In this tutorial, we're going to use the ``pages`` application to create some pages announcing for a contest that you're organization is having. We'll cover creating pages, moving them around in the page hierarchy, editing their content with links and images and using the draft functionality to control which pages we show.

You just had the amazing idea to hold a contest encouraging people to create youtube videos advertising how *awesome* your organization is. You've heard about this social media thing, and you're going to go viral all over it, or something. You want to get a page up explaining and advertising the contest (so you can tweet it, obviously) and you also need to explain the details and publish the winners.

Creating the Contest's Home Page
================================

Create home page as a root page
-------------------------------

The first task is creating the home page for your contest. You need a slick page with a link to your youtube account and some awesome images to showcase your organization. You also want to make show the page to a few select people before you link it up for everyone to see.

Edit the page's contents
------------------------

1. Login with your account (which has permission to edit pages) and browse the pages adminstrator section via :menuselection:`Admin --> Pages`. From there, hit the ``Add New Page`` link to open up the form for creating a new page.

.. Todo:

	SS here with the Add New Page button highlighted

2. Title the page ``Contest 3008`` (because you're not `2000 and late <http://google.com/search/?boom+boom+boom>`_) and select the default template. 

3. In the body block, type in ``Contest 3008`` and hit enter to create a block of text. Then put your cursor back in that block of text and click the ``header 1`` link on the right. This Turns that bit of text in to a heading, making it display appropriately on the page with larger text.

4. In a text block after your heading, hitting the ``paragraph`` link on the right if it's not displayed as a normal paragraph, type in the following text::
	
	This is some text.

5. Wouldn't it be cool if we linked directly to Youtube?
