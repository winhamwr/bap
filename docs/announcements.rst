Site-wide Announcements
***********************

Announcements are messages that you can send to your site users via email and via a text display on the website when they login. Announcements are useful for reminding people to do things like fill out their profile or to call their attention to new features on the site.

Users with the appropriate :ref:`user-permissions` can display announcements targeted at specific types of site visitors. Browsing to the Announcement Management screen via :menuselection:`Admin --> Announcements` and selecting ``Add Announcement`` brings you to a screen with the option to provide announcement text and target the announcement at either logged-in users or anonymous users. Active announcements are displayed at the top of every page and ensure that users see them at least once.

If a user has unchecked the box on the ``Notifications`` screen next to email alerts for announcements, they will no longer receive emails for all announcements.
