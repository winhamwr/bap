Scheduled Events
================

Members of the ``BAP Content Editor`` group are capable of creating and editing scheduled events. These events are displayed on the front calendar and give members the ability to register for them and to log their attendance for them.

Creating an Event
-----------------

To create a professional event, as an example, browse via :menuselection: `Schedule --> Professional Events -->` to the PE calendar. From there, simply click on the data you would like to place the event, and a menu will appear asking for relevant event information. After saving the event, you will need to reload the page and then it will appear on the calendar in the appropriate position.

If you need to create a community or social event, simply select that calendar from the selection instead of the professional event calendar.

Editing an Event
----------------

Events can be edited by clicking their box from either the mini-calendar or the full calendar (found via :menuselection: `Schedule --> Calendar`). Clicking the box will show a dialog with an `Edit` link option.

.. _event_registration:

Event Registration
==================

Members of the ``BAP Event RSVP Admin`` are capable of controlling event signups for all scheduled events. At the event dialog, they can click :menuselection: `Reservations --> Modify RSVP List` to set a limit to the number of available slots and remove/add people from the RSVP list.

By default, there is no limit to the number of users who can RSVP for an event.

Users can also view their and other peoples' reservations under the ``RSVPs`` tab.

.. _attendance:

Attendance
==========

Members of the ``BAP Attendance Admin`` group are able to take attendance, modify attendance after the fact, and view attendance reports. The scheduled duration of an event is the number of hours that will be awarded for attendance, so to change the number of hours, simply modify the stop time for the event.

Taking Attendance
-----------------

While at the particular event that needs attendance, the attendance admin can login, via the event dialog, select ``Attendance`` and then click ``Event Signup`` to bring up the attendance signin form.

The attendance admin can then allow attenders to use that laptop to sign in with their usernames and passwords to indicate that they attended.

Modifying Attendance
--------------------

The attendance admin can click the ``Modify Attendance`` link on the attendance screen for a particular event in order to change which members get attendance credit for an event.

Attendance Reporting
--------------------

All users have the ability to view their and others' attendance. Both options are available from the ``Attendance`` tab.

Using Attendance Data in Excel
------------------------------

For Nationals reporting purposes, the summary tables can by copy/pasted in to excel while retaining their data. Some manually modification is required to fit the  data in to the specific worksheet format that's required, but copy/paste should greatly reduce any need for manual entry/copy.
