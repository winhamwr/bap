Tutorial: Using Youtube and Flickr to Manage Media
**************************************************

The internet is full of great tools to help you manage your videos, photos and graphics and integrating their power in to your site is surprisingly simple. We'll walk through creating accounts, uploading content, organizing your content and then using :ref:`pages` to integrate that content with our site.

.. Note:

These instructions focus on using `Youtube <http://youtube.com>`_ and `Flickr <http://flickr.com>`_ for the task, but other options like `Vimeo <http://vimeo.com>`_ and `Picassa <http://picassa.google.com>`_ are also good options.

Flickr for Photos
=================

Creating an Account
-------------------

Navigate to http://www.flickr.com/signup/ and create an account. It's recommended that you create one BAP account and give several people access so that your media is in one place.

Adding Images 
-------------

Navigate to http://www.flickr.com/photos/upload/ and upload whichever images you'd like to add. Descriptions and tags are generally useful for organizing images, and will be displayed when you embed slideshows for visitors. You'll want to make sure and set the privacy on your photos to public so that site visitors can see them.

Grouping Images
---------------

From your photostream, you'll want to group related photos in to sets. This lets you create specific slideshows, if for example you'd like to show a stream of all of the photos from a particular event.

Youtube for Videos
==================

Creating, uploading and tagging videos in Youtube is very similar to doing the same with pictures on flickr. Create a shared account, upload the videos, tag them for organization and then they'll all be available through your channel at http://www.youtube.com/user/YOURUSERNAME (replacing ``YOURUSERNAME`` with your actual youtube username)

Integrating Your Media
======================

Embedding Slideshows
--------------------

To embed a flickr slideshow on a page, you need to do 3 things
1. Create the set you'd like to display and find the url to that set
2. Use http://flickrslidr.com to generate html that you can embed on one of your pages
3. Insert that html on the page using the editor

To find the url of your set, go to your photostream and then select a set. Copy the url from your browser bar.

Navigate to http://flickrslidr.com/ and paste your url in the url section. Then click ``Create slideshow!`` and copy the html that's provided.

Login as a content administrator on the BAP site and create/edit the desired page, following the documentation on that part of the site if you need help. Once you're on the page editor, you need to click the ``HTML`` button on the editor (3rd from the right) which will allow you to directly edit the HTML code for the page. Paste in the HTML from flickrslidr and save the page.

Embedding Videos
----------------

Embedding youtube videos on the site is similar to embedding slideshows, except it's easier to get the HTML to cut/paste. Simply view your video in youtube and on the right side, in the ``about`` section, copy the ``Embed`` code and use that to paste in to the HTML of the BAP page.

Showing Latest Content
----------------------

To embed all of your flickr content, you follow the normal flickr steps except instead of using a url to a set of pictures, you use the url to your photostream.

To embed all of your youtube videos in a playlist, you'll use http://www.youtubereloaded.com/ to generate the HTML. Instead of needing to find a specific URL, you can enter in your username under ``User's Uploads`` to create a playlist of all your latest content. You'll then paste that HTML on to the BAP page you'd like to view.

Linking Accounts Back to Your Site
----------------------------------

To make sure that people finding your flickr and youtube accounts can end up back at your site, you'll want to fill out profile information on both account with links back to http://iubap.org

For youtube, navigate to your channel and click ``Settings`` in the top bar next to ``Edit Channel``. Add the iubap.org url in the Title section of the channel.

For flickr, you'll want to edit your profile and add a ``Describe Yourself`` saying that you're the BAP account and a ``Your website address`` pointing to iubap.org
